I was trying to find a light way to have a spinner in a project, i found a very good code in this [page](http://projects.lukehaas.me/css-loaders/).

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/assets/files/css/loader.css">

<div class="loader"> &nbsp;</div>

To make this work, just load this css file and than put class loader in a div
